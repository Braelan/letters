	Who is the real heretic? He is the one with the inward smile.  If the heretic is against everything, he is really no heretic at all.  The true heretic is cloaked and decorated in the truth so that he can compensate the one evil that nourishes him.  Then he has camouflage.  
</p>
<p>
	Partly the heressy is about truth, partly about disgrace, and partly about joy.  
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the heretic is like Shakespeares Cassius, lean and hungry.  He is a healthy spirit, sometimes a strong spirit but he is not a fat one.   
</p>

<p>
	The joy of heresy, is the entertainment of Peter denying Christ.  It is as if he is tickled into saying it.  At the beggining of the night as he is talking to Christ he is so earnest that he could never speak against truth, the picture of the good friend.  But Christ kids him, almost double dog dares him... Your going to deny me, your going to deny me.  And Peter sheepishly, no I won't, no I won't.    
</p>
<p>
Later on, when he does deny Christ, it's almost as if someone has told Peter a good joke, maybe one about entry into Heaven and then said OK now, don't laugh, and Peter tries to hold back the laughter but can't.  This is true heresy, heresy that comes from the gut like the catharsis of long awaited tears.  And then the cockerel crows at day break, Jesus is on the cross and there is a score to settle.

Breaking rules and getting away with it, or breaking them and getting caught.  In this way the Thief and the Heretic are the same.  Good thieves and heretics have to be clever and enjoy what they are doing or they won't last long in their professions.  Too small a transgression and there is no Joy, too large and the game is up.  So the heretic has to be known as a heretic, but there ought to be doubters as well, haters who would say, no he is not a true heretic, only he hasn't understood completely.  The good heretic though is heritical at heart.  Knows the joys of hipocracy more acutely than the Priest.  What separates him from the politician is that rather than seeking plausible deniability, he seeks implausible deniability.  If a politician were more implausible he would be a heretic, if a heretic were more implausible he would be burned at the stake.

<p>
The joy comes from the spirit transending itself and doing something that it felt maybe it wasn't capable of.  At first these are the tentative steps of walking on thin ice.  Then either falling through or progressing to a greater confidence.  It is the ambivalent feeling about evil that wins the heretics allies.  Knowing good and evil is like checking to see if the cookies are done yet.  They weren't done five minutes ago, maybe now, nope, let's try a few more.  So the heretic is there to check.  Is it evil still... yep... still evil?... yep... now?  oh, that's pretty good, this time we really got away.   Heretics need anonimity, hideouts and getaways to be successful, reliance on part time heretics.  
</p>


<p>
So I think the other characteristic of the good heretic is the possibility of repentence.  A witch has made the pact with devil and her soul is going to burn eternally no matter what, so why not start the fire early.  The good heretic on the other hand has withheld something.  He has seen some of his comrades cowering and some of them on the stake and he looks, like the Buddha, for the middle road.  The enlightenened heretic.
