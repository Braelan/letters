<div class="letter heressies">
	Who is the real heretic? He is the one with the inward smile.  If the heretic is against everything, he is really no heretic at all.  The true heretic is cloaked and decorated in the truth so that he can compensate the one evil that nourishes him.  Then he has camouflage.  

	Partly the heressy is about truth, partly about disgrace, and partly about joy.  

	The joy of heresy, is the entertainment of Peter denying Christ.  It is as if he is tickled into saying it.  At the beggining of the night as he is talking to Christ he is so earnest that he could never speak against truth, the picture of the good friend.  But Christ kids him, almost double dog dares him... Your going to deny me, your going to deny me.  And Peter sheepishly, no I won't, no I won't.    

Later on, when he does deny Christ, it's almost as if someone has told Peter a good joke, maybe one about entry into Heaven and then said OK now, don't laugh, and Peter tries to hold back the laughter but can't.  This is true heresy, heresy that comes from the gut like the catharsis of long awaited tears.  And then the cockerel crows at day break, Jesus is on the cross and there is a score to settle.
