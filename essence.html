	Behind the blood, marrow, brain and neuron, rooted in a world that is not entirely are own and yet is the essence of us lies 
	the spirit.  This is a fictional scientific enquiry into this dimension.  It is a sketch of what it means to have a soul in Bellingham, WA using the language of the internet, and fracturing it and placing it back together in a cute mosaic.  It is using the language of the 21st century to create a new myth of the soul.  
</p>
<p>
Since Enlightenment thought pushed concern with the immortal soul to the background of Western pursuits, it was rediscovered  in Freud and Jungs analysis of the subconcious. Needing to tie the soul to the physical realm of science they framed the spirit in the family and sexuality.  Taoism confirmed that sexuality and libido was only part of the story.  It is a source of energy, but it is not the enrgy and it does not define the direction of that energy.  Look to nature, the environment, or maybe even the Christian soul (seperate from the carnal worl) for that.   
</p>

<p> 
	There is something personal, individual and unique about an individuals essence that makes its understanding the 
	subject of an individuals own introspection and defies rational scientific experimentation.  Nevertheless, perhaps what we 
	are speaking of is nothing more than the subconcious.  Anyone who feels this way is, of course, one hundred percent correct 
	for themselves, but I also invite wayward souls on a different sort of adventure.    
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, spirit may be something that inhabits a place.  In this interpretation it is possible to absorb the energy 
	of a location.  A person absorbs a different energy from the forrest than they do from the ocean.  This is obvious to anyone who knows that the fairies of the trees are much different from the nymphs of the ocean.  What may not be so obvious is if one of these spirits can inhabit the human body, or an animal body.  Can there spirit be our spirit?  In shinto, spirits live in 
	the mountains, the woods, the caves, perhaps even the city.  So it is possible to embody one of these individual spirits, that 	      embody it in human flesh.  This is, of course, what the dali llama has done, he has encarnated the spirit of the previous dali	    llamas.    
</p>

<p>
  Rhythm also falls into this category, we feel it, it comes from outside of us and suddenly, without concious thought we find ourselves moving to it.  Other signals that the body is recieving without always presenting them to the mind for conscious dissection include the temperature, the tension and position of our muscles, the scenery at the edge of our visual field.  Could these sensory inputs in their entirety be said to constitute the spirit of a place?  There is something more.
</p>

<p>
  On the plane of the spirit, Jung muses that, "we are all splinters of the divine."  I think that captures the experience of having a
persistent soul that nevertheless inhabits a connectedness with other people and things at different moments in time.  That idea is that we are all manifestations of a divine spirit. 
</p>

<p>
  Some of us god spent more time on though, our charismatic leaders that inspire our own spirits and energize us to find greater completion and realization of our subconcious animus.
</p>

<p>
How our we supposed to realize ourselves?  First we have to understand ourselves, and by ourselves I mean our souls.  Then it is the ambition of the soul that must be fulfilled.  To hell with the ambition of the conscious mind if it is only artifact from some other souls yearning for power, for fulfillment and completion.
</p>

<p>
I would also like to talk about the heart though, certainly, the correct rhythm and the correct smell are capable of moving the heart.
If the heart is not the soul, then it is certainly close to it.  And the soul can not move without the heart.  No, the soul must move with the heart.  If the heart is not in something, it can still be done, but it is done soullessly.  If something is done soul lessly
then I imagine it still has it's own spirit, it's just that it's spirit is the absence of spirit.  When it is said that 'the heart will find a home' or 'donde la corazon inclina, los pies camina'  what is meant is that something must be felt.  A person will yearn for something, and despite the machinations of their concious mind, they will find themselves embodying actions that move toward that yearning.  Actions that conform to the deeper reality of the heart.  
</p>

<p>
  I once met a devout person who considered divorce a mortal sin.  She had a bout of psychosis and left the marriage, but then recovered once she went to her mothers home.  Isn't this the action of the subconcious, the action of the heart?

</p>

<p>
Even this though is another digression, because the heart implies a power or a force whereas the spirit or soul implies a way of being in the world.  Perhaps someone could be soulful and yet have a weak heart, maybe an elderly person at peace with their own animus would fall into this category.
</p>

<p>
The soul must also be something that we can talk to.  The geni captures this well.  That is the geni like Aladdins geni, but also the 
geni like a persons genius.  It is the entity that is capable of inspiration, but it whispers to the concious mind almost in a sort of conspiracy against the world if only a person will listen.
