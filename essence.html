	Behind the blood, marrow, brain and neuron, rooted in a world that is not entirely are own and yet is the essence of us lies 
	the spirit.  This is a fictional scientific enquiry into this dimension.  It is a sketch of what it means to have a soul in Bellingham, WA using the language of the internet, and fracturing it and placing it back together in a mosaic.  It is using the language of the 21st century to create a new myth of the soul.

<p>
Since Enlightenment thought pushed concern with the immortal soul to the background of Western pursuits, it was rediscovered  in Freud and Jungs analysis of the subconcious. Needing to tie the soul to the physical realm of science they framed the spirit in the family and sexuality.

<p> 
	There is something personal, individual and unique about an individuals essence that makes its understanding the 
	subject of an individuals own introspection and defies rational scientific experimentation.  Nevertheless, perhaps what we 
	are speaking of is nothing more than the subconcious.

	Alternatively, spirit may be something that inhabits a place.  In this interpretation it is possible to absorb the energy 
	of a location.  A person absorbs a different energy from the forrest than they do from the ocean.  In shinto, spirits live in 
	the mountains, the woods, the caves, perhaps even the city.  So it is possible to embody one of these individual spirits, that 	      embody it in human flesh.  This is, of course, what the dali llama has done, he has encarnated the spirit of the previous dali	    llamas.

<p>
  Rhythm also falls into this category, we feel it, it comes from outside of us and suddenly, without concious thought we find ourselves moving to it.  Other signals that the body is recieving without always presenting them to the mind for conscious dissection include the temperature, the tension and position of our muscles, the scenery at the edge of our visual field.  Could these sensory inputs in their entirety be said to constitute the spirit of a place?

At heart, what I would like to do is
