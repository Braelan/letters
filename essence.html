	Behind the blood, marrow, brain and neuron, rooted in a world that is not entirely are own and yet is the essence of us lies 
	the spirit.  This is a fictional scientific enquiry into this dimension.  It is a sketch of what it means to have a soul in Bellingham, WA using the language of the internet, and fracturing it and placing it back together in a cute mosaic.  It is using the language of the 21st century to create a new myth of the soul.  It is lazy and amaturish, meant to be kicked around and abused, or in other words, out of the clinic and into the coffeeshop.  Writing this I hope to be elusive, because that is how the soul is in my mind, its understanding ephemeral and only sometimes clear, and yet present.     
</p>
<p>
Since Enlightenment thought pushed concern with the immortal soul to the background of Western pursuits, it was rediscovered  in Freud and Jungs analysis of the subconcious. Needing to tie the soul to the physical realm of science they framed the spirit in the family and sexuality.  Taoism confirmed that sexuality and libido was only part of the story.  It is a source of energy, but it is not the enrgy and it does not define the direction of that energy.  Look to nature, the environment, or maybe even the Christian soul (seperate from the carnal world) for that.   
</p>

<p> 
	There is something personal, and unique about an individuals essence that makes its understanding an elusive quest founded in ones own introspection and defies rational scientific experimentation.  The essence knows it's triumphs and catastrophes, in some sense has already understood the whole life from birth to death timelessly and all at once.  It understands its own place in the world and grasps the archetypical contours of the being.  Nevertheless, perhaps what we 
	are speaking of is nothing more than the subconcious.  That is fine, as long as the subconcious speaks to the very boundaries of my knowingness, as long as it plumbs to the depths of my being in such a way that I no longer know where I end and the next entity begins.    
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, spirit may be something that inhabits a place.  In this interpretation it is possible to absorb the energy 
	of a location.  A person absorbs a different energy from the forrest than they do from the ocean.  This is obvious to anyone who knows that the fairies of the trees are much different from the nymphs of the ocean.  What may not be so obvious is if one of these spirits can inhabit the human body, or an animal body.  Can there spirit be our spirit?  In shinto, spirits live in 
	the mountains, the woods, the caves, perhaps even the city.  So it is possible to embody one of these individual spirits, that 	      embody it in human flesh.  This is, of course, what the dali llama has done, he has encarnated the spirit of the previous dali	    llamas.    
</p>

<p>
If it is the place that our souls draw character from, then maybe it is the things to.  The talismans that give their owner emmense power if they know how to wield it.  Does the soul attact (gravitationally) the talisman to it, our does the talisman attract the soul?
Ogun, the spirit of modernity inhabits the artificial industrial world that we created, so the machines are spirit. 

</p>

<p>
  Sound and Rhythm also falls into this category, we feel it, it comes from outside of us and suddenly, without concious thought we find ourselves moving to it.  Moreover, sometimes we resonate with other people, the outpouring of our souls find a wavelength with the other, enters into their minds and bodies, bounces around, amplifies and returns.  Other signals that the body is recieving without always presenting them to the mind for conscious dissection include the temperature, the tension and position of our muscles, the scenery at the edge of our visual field.  Could these sensory inputs in their entirety be said to constitute the spirit of a place?  There is something more.
</p>

<p>
  On the plane of the spirit, Jung muses that, "we are all splinters of the divine."  I think that captures the experience of having a
persistent soul that nevertheless inhabits a connectedness with other people and things at different moments in time.  That idea is that we are all manifestations of a divine spirit.  Here I use divine in the monotheistic all encompassing sense, the divine of Spinoza and Hegel that is everywhere expanding and folding in to know itself like a plume of ink from an octopuses gut.  This is the rastafarian spirit 'I and I' as opposed to 'You and I.'   
</p>

<p>
This view gives a little bit of detachment and allows badness and evil to enjoy itself.  An egoist tends to regard lazyness, sadness, decay, all the antithesis of productivity, health and joy as states of being to be struggled against.  The one spirit view, needs the inactive (yin) elements.  Robert Dineros Scarface says, "The world needs people like me." Rather than impediments to the spirit as in the sloth, greed, incest of Chrisianity, sloth, greed, incest become the spirit.  The spirit in some instances seeks d'evils (Jay -Z) and is fulfilled by demonstrating them.  Malcolm X is fulfilled by theft, Jay - Z is fulfilled by creating crack addicts, Iceburg Slim by pimping, Nancy Friday by sexual fantasy,  Kurt Cobain by his implaccable sadness, Oppenheimer by unleashing nuclear forces capable of world destruction.  Paradoxically, to waste life can be to fulfill it.  A spirit meant for decay would dulled if compelled to create.

<p>
  Some of us god spent more time on though, our charismatic leaders that inspire our own spirits and energize us to find greater completion and realization of our subconcious animus.
</p>

<p>
How our we supposed to realize ourselves?  First we have to understand ourselves, and by ourselves I mean our souls.  Then it is the ambition of the soul that must be fulfilled.  Conversely, goals that the concious mind expected to have, upon introspection, may be found to be vacuous. This opens a path to self forgiveness.  When Nietsche's Zarathrustra comes down from the mountain after attaining enlightenment with his sacred tablets and prophesizes that god is dead, what he has done is freed the soul.  I echo that call to freedom.
</p>
<p>
In the words of 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar', I want to scratch my own itches, the itches of the soul.
</p>
<p>
I would also like to talk about the heart though, certainly, the correct rhythm and the correct smell are capable of moving the heart.
If the heart is not the soul, then it is certainly close to it.  And the soul can not move without the heart.  No, the soul must move with the heart.  If the heart is not in something, it can still be done, but it is done soullessly.  If something is done soul lessly
then I imagine it still has it's own spirit, it's just that it's spirit is the absence of spirit.  When it is said that 'the heart will find a home' or 'donde la corazon inclina, los pies camina'  what is meant is that something must be felt.  A person will yearn for something, and despite the machinations of their concious mind, they will find themselves embodying actions that move toward that yearning.  Actions that conform to the deeper reality of the heart.  
</p>

<p>
  I once met a devout person who considered divorce a mortal sin.  She had a bout of psychosis and left the marriage, but then recovered once she went to her mothers home.  Isn't this the action of the subconcious, the action of the heart?  Unable to escape a marriage through a legal means, the heart drives the conciousness to madness long enough that the person can get situation, then recovers lucididty.

</p>

<p>
Even this though is another digression, because the heart implies a power or a force whereas the spirit or soul implies a way of being in the world.  Perhaps someone could be soulful and yet have a weak heart, maybe an elderly person at peace with their own animus would fall into this category.
</p>

<p>
The soul must also be something that we can talk to.  The geni captures this well.  That is the geni like Aladdins geni, but also the 
geni like a persons genius.  It is the entity that is capable of inspiration, but it whispers to the concious mind almost in a sort of conspiracy against the world if only a person will listen.
</p>

<p> Certainly, the Geni is also mysterious, he arrives, grants some wishes and vanishes.  Isn't that like the soul sometimes, to be walking with you, and then like the cheshire cat, to leave you suddenly tragically alone.  Or is the soul like a shadow that follows us everywhere.  And when the Geni comes and places his enchantments, giving the magical dreamlike quality to certain moments in life, has he acted on mind, that is the mind via the spirit, or has he acted on the world itself?
</p>


<p> 
If I am going to be a friend to myself, who will be the friend and who will be the myself.  Likewise if I am to listen to myself, who is the speaker and who is the listener.  Writing this essay, if I am thinking, 'this is no good', who am I thinking to?  If it were just one entity wouldn't it already know?  I posit that it is the cortex talking to the amygdala, or the concious mind talking to the spirit.  So then when talking to ourselves, we are talking to our geni, sometimes encouraging it and sometimes censoring it.  What I would like to do is let it speak for itself, or at least express itself in the world.  The geni seems to have a mind of its own anyway.  The difficulty is, that since I didn't conciously choose it, should I really allow it to speak?  What if it isn't nice?
</p>

<p>
  The not niceness is important.  Our ancestors are monkey soldiers. They are tricksters.  Maybe the geni wants to sell your cows for magic beans, and the geni designs to steal said cows and run.  Maybe the beans are magic or maybe they are not.   
</p>

<p>
  Speaking of the heart and soul together is passion.  It is the desire to reach out into the universe and communicate something, to take an idea, let it sit deep inside of you and blossom into something else that explodes out to renew the cycle.  This animus is sometimes controlled and sometimes not.  Certainly though, the passion comes from outside, excites the inside, and then flows out.  The outside must speak to the inside, that is it must touch the soul, and the inside must speak to the outside, it must touch another soul as well.  How do we know? Through the eyes.
