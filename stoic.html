<div class="letter friendly stoicism">
<p>
"To be a man is precisely to be responsible.  It is to know shame at the sight of what seems to be unmerited misery.  It is to be proud of a victory won by our comrades.  It is to feel as we place our stone, that we are contributing to the building of the world"
 </p>

-Antoine de Saint-Exupery

In 1776 the year of both the American and French revolutions that ended the monarchies and started Republican government and nationalism, there must have been a sense of creating a new world.  Then again as Industrialism emerged, and now I am imagining a new world once again.  The features are difficult to make out, and it is only now emerging from a haze, but I will suggest stoicism and friendship as two of its defining virtues, in contrast to the abundance that characterized the last 100 years.

Epictitus' stoic laughter rings from 55 AD because he was not a Puritan.  Like the Puritans he believed in simplicity, but he certainly didn't believe in hard work.  It was enough to have a bed, a lamp, a cooking pot and a toga.  Other material comforts were superfluous.  To work for them was to put yourself into slavery.  I find myself aspiring to ataraxia, in the face of my diminishing material prospects.  Searching for a philosophy that embraces lower income without sacrificing dignity.  The challenge then is to cut the stones for the new world smaller, but to make them more ornate.  Each stone should by more joyful because it is better able to know itself and use its more limited resources more wisely.  To pattern our stones after the stones of the last century is to run out of material.

Epictetus after all was not a Puritan.  He was free person, valuing freedom above all else.  Isn't that what we traded for when we opted for the internet?  Didn't we ask for more freedom of thought, to build a great library that would show us all of the ways that humanity has thought about the problems that we are bound to face?  When it comes to living with less, history is a long story of how to live with less.  How to live with less room, less comfort, less heat, less safety, and ultimately less years.

Frienship that endures and is forged from adversity is one of Stoicisms answers.  It is to be taken seriously, as seriously as the home and the car was in the previous century.  Friendship in this new era is oil (Maya Angelou).  Ultimately, it is the answer to the misery that comes from shrinking economic fortune.  When we go down together, eschewing the consumption that used to come to us so easily, we allay the suffering that comes from unfullfilled expectations.  This is the 'unmerited misery', and needless suffering that greets us in the 21st century, and it is my responsibility to address it through increased friendship.

We are also greeted with an intellectual abundance, and luxuriousness that has never been known.  So if I am to be stoic in a material sense, let me be stoic like the student, all the while exploring at liberty the vast expanses of thought that are opening and pointing their way towards new delicious horizons.  Let me find stoical connections with the South Americans who have lived with less for the past 200 years, with the South Asians, who know so well how to get the most out smaller spaces and different noises.  We are online worldwide, and our new found American scarcity is an invitation to seek out people the world over who we can now relate to.  We trade material abundance, but we gain information and the heart to learn.
